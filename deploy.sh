# git pull happens in the workflow's SSH command, before this script is invoked — NOT in
# here. bash reads a script from disk as it executes it; if this script pulled its own
# new content mid-run, later lines would be read from the wrong file offset once the pull
# rewrote it underneath the running process (observed: it kept running the pre-pull
# version of this exact file after a pull that should have fixed the very bug it hit).
